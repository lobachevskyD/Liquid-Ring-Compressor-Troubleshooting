# Liquid-Ring-Compressor-Troubleshooting
This is a Python script that uses the customtkinter library to create a graphical user interface with dropdown menus and buttons. The script contains three dictionaries that store information related to troubleshooting compressor, including symptom descriptions, possible causes, and troubleshooting steps. The GUI allows users to select a symptom, which populates a dropdown menu with possible causes. Once a cause is selected, a button can be pressed to display troubleshooting steps for that cause. The GUI also includes two images for the buttons, one for light mode and one for dark mode.
